## What is this application?
I was very interested to learn MongoDB. I thought, the best way to learn how to use it is to create a few applications using the Mongoose documentations.
This Shopping list is the first such application, using the MERN tech stack.

## Front end
The frontend is a React website written in JavaScript

## Backend      
The backend was written in Node.js using Express.js library to create the CRUD routes 

## Database
In this app, I have used MongoDB, mainly because I was interested how it works and I wanted to learn how to use the MERN teck stack.
